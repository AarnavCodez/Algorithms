# Algorithms
Algorithms is a repo for me that holds all my algorithms I created with Python.

## Current Files
### 1. Sort Algorithm - ```sort_list()```
Sort arrays by ascending or descending order. Use numbers only, and have at ease with sorting! This is made without using the built-in ```sorted()``` function
Takes 2 parameters: ```numbers``` and ```order```. Insert a list of numbers at the ```numbers``` parameter, and the order you want at the ```order``` parameter. Select the
order by passing in the booleans: ```True``` for ascending, and ```False``` for descending.

### 2. Binary Search - ```binary_search()```
An easy and complex way of finding the index of a specific element. Scan through a big array, and find the place of your specific item. Uses the concept of *Binary Search*
Takes 2 parameters: ```sequence``` and ```item```. Put an array at the ```sequence``` parameter, and the item you want to search for on the ```item``` parameter.

### 3. Find Max - ```find_max()```
Find the biggest number in a list. Made without using the built-in function
Takes 1 parameter: ```numbers```. Insert a list at this parameter.

### 4. Two Sum - ```two_sum()```
Insert a number and find 2 elements in the array that are addends of your number.

### 5. Append, Insert, Delete
Three built-in functions that are made from scratch. The ```my_append()``` function adds an item at the end of the list. The ```my_insert()``` works like the append but you can
insert an item anywhere. The ```my_delete()``` function deletes a specific element. Do not put the element, instead put the index of the element to delete.
